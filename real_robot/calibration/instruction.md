    Paper: Matte paper is best. Glossy paper reflects light (specular reflection), creating "blind spots" for the camera.

    Mounting: Glue it to a stiff board (foam board, acrylic, or a clipboard). It must be perfectly flat. A flexible piece of paper will warp your calibration results.

    Printer Settings: CRITICAL! Set scaling to "None" or "100%" (Do not use "Fit to Page").

    Verification: After printing, use digital calipers to measure the total length of the black/white squares. If it's off by even 1mm, your robot will be inaccurate.
