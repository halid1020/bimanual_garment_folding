  # --- GROUP 2: THE "LADDER" (Height Variation) ---
  # These work well for you. We need these to fix the scale.

  # --- GROUP 4: GENTLE YAW TILTS (Left/Right) ---
  # Wrist 2 changes. Reduced angle to +/- 10 degrees (was 17+)
  # AND we slightly rotate Base to compensate for the board moving sideways.
  
  # Tilt Left (Wrist 2: -167 -> -157, Base: 90 -> 95)

  # --- GROUP 5: GENTLE TWISTS (Rotation) ---
